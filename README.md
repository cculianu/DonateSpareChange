# Donate Spare Change - Electron Cash Plugin 

![Icon](resources/icon64.png)

A plugin for Electron Cash that allows you to donate spare 'change' unspent outputs ('Coins' in Electron Cash parlance) automatically, after a certain age and below a certain amount, to charity.  This has the added benefit of preventing change outputs from being recombined with your addreses thus preserving your privacy.

## Security Warning ##

I, Calin Culianu (cculianu) author of this plugin, affirm that there is no malicious code intentionally added to this plugin.  If you obtain this plugin from any source other than this github repository, proceed at your own risk!

The reason this needs to be said, is that an enabled Electron Cash plugin has almost complete access and potential control over any wallets that are open.

## Usage ##

Once you have the plugin installed and enabled, you may use it.

1. Select the `Donate Change` tab.
2. ... More here later ...
